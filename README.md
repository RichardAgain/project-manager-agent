# Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

## 1. Install `uv`

If you don't have `uv` installed, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install uv
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

Create virtual environment and install dependencies using `uv sync`:

```bash
uv sync
```

This will set up your project with all required dependencies.
